# Security Hardening

Treat editor content as untrusted input unless your pipeline explicitly guarantees trust.

## Baseline controls

- Sanitize HTML server-side before rendering.
- Validate URLs (`http`, `https`, `mailto`, `tel`) for link/image attributes.
- Restrict uploads by size/type and enforce virus scanning where required.
- Apply CSP and clickjacking protections on render pages.

## Rendering strategy

- Prefer rendering from trusted JSON model in your app runtime.
- Escape user text where raw HTML injection paths exist.
- Keep sanitization logic versioned and covered by tests.
