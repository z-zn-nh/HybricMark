# Custom Slash Menu

HybricMark is context-first by default, but slash interactions can be extended through Tiptap extensions.

## Integration path

- Implement a custom extension/plugin for slash command detection.
- Pass it through `extensions`.
- Keep command rendering state in your app layer when menu complexity grows.

## Example shape

```tsx
import type { Extension } from '@tiptap/core'

const MySlashExtension: Extension = /* your extension */

<HybricEditor
  content={doc}
  extensions={[MySlashExtension]}
/>
```

## Product-level recommendations

- Group commands by intent (`format`, `insert`, `actions`).
- Reuse labels and shortcuts from context menu for consistency.
- Keep top commands keyboard-first for speed.
