# Troubleshooting

## Editor appears blank

- Confirm `hybricmark/style.css` and `katex` CSS are imported.
- In SSR apps, ensure client-only mount (`dynamic(..., { ssr: false })`).
- Check browser console for module/chunk loading errors.

## Chinese IME issues or cursor jumps

- Do not push parent `content` back into editor each keystroke.
- Keep editor uncontrolled while composing input.

## Save requests are too frequent

- Move persistence logic to `onDebouncedUpdate`.
- Increase `debounceMs` for large documents.

## Context menu action is disabled

- Check whether current action requires text selection.
- Verify current selection is inside a compatible node (for table actions).

## Table action not applied

- Confirm cursor is in a table cell.
- Avoid overriding table keymaps/commands without forwarding defaults.
