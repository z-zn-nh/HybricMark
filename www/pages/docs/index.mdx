# HybricMark Documentation

HybricMark is a production-oriented, headless markdown editor for React built on top of Tiptap.

This documentation is written for engineers integrating editor capabilities into real products.

## What is different from plain Tiptap setup?

- Built-in block UUID strategy (`attrs.id`) for paragraph/heading/list workflows.
- Typora-like interaction defaults (context-first, markdown shortcut-friendly).
- Opinionated integration surface focused on writing products.
- Ready-to-use persistence hook (`onDebouncedUpdate`) to avoid write storms.
