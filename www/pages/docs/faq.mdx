# FAQ

## Is this a complete Notion clone?

No. HybricMark is an editor core and integration surface, not a full app framework.

## Can I use it in Next.js?

Yes. Mount editor surfaces client-side (`dynamic(..., { ssr: false })`).

## Should I store Markdown or JSON?

JSON is recommended for block-level operations and UUID-based workflows.

## Why is `onDebouncedUpdate` important?

Saving on every keystroke leads to heavy write pressure and race conditions. Debounce persistence for stability.

## Is output safe by default?

Client-side safeguards exist, but backend sanitization is still mandatory.

## Can I replace context menu UI?

Yes. The library is headless-oriented. You can wrap and rewire interaction layers.

## Can I add custom Tiptap extensions?

Yes. Use the `extensions` prop to merge your extensions into the default stack.
